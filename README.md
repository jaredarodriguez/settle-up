# PROJECT TITLE : 'Settle-Up'

#Settle-up is an app specific for bands who don't have accountants. On the road, money can be made, but most often is spent. It's not always easy to keep track of who is spending money and can get confusing when it comes down to determining who owes who.

#On the dashboard this app will provide a snapshot of what members owe money and to who. Because a band is considered one entity anytime money is spent, it is a shared expense and vice versa.

#The log sheet is its own separate view. A nav bar will help the user get to that page. On the page, there will be an option to use a drop down bar for month user wishes to create expense. Once the user clicks a month, it will bring them to a page outlining how money was made and spent
