# PROJECT TITLE : 'settle-up'

#Settle-up is an app specific for bands who don't have accountants. On the road, money can be made, but most often is spent. It's not always easy to keep track of who is spending money and can get confusing when it comes down to determining who owes who.

#On the dashboard this app will provide a snapshot of what members owe money and to who. Because a band is considered one entity anytime money is spent, it is a shared expense and vice versa.

#The log sheet is its own separate view. A nav bar will help the user get to that page. On the page, there will be an option to use a drop down bar for month user wishes to create expense. Once the user clicks a month, it will bring them to a page outlining how money was made and spent

# User stories:

#AAU I want to be able to login into a shared account using login credentials such as a user id and password

#AAU I want to be able to see who owes me money and to whom I owe

#AAU I want to be able to catalog expenses with a drop down menu that displays on it typical expenses associated with being in a band: gas, food, gear, hotels, tolls, etc.

#AAU I want to be able to see a breakdown of how money is being spent and earned by month. In order to do this I plan on using D3

#Stretch goals:

#add a feature that sends notification when an expense is added

#add the ability for user to type in transaction not found in dropdown menu which sends to misc. category
